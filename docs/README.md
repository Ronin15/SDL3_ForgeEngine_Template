## Getting Started

### System Overview
The Forge Game Engine provides several core systems that work together:
- **Core Engine**: GameEngine singleton and GameLoop timing systems
- **Utility Systems**: Logger, Worker Budget, and core utility classes
- **AI System**: Behavior management for NPCs with threading support
- **Event System**: Global event handling for weather, spawning, and custom events
- **UI System**: Professional interface components with theming and animations
- **Threading System**: Multi-threaded task processing with priority scheduling
- **Manager Systems**: Resource management for fonts, textures, audio, and more

### Quick Links

- **[UI Quick Start](ui/UIManager_Guide.md#quick-start)** - Create UI components instantly
- **[Threading Setup](ThreadSystem.md#quick-start)** - Initialize multi-threading

## Key Features

### Modern Architecture
- **Singleton Engine Management**: Centralized system coordination
- **Fixed/Variable Timestep**: Deterministic updates with smooth rendering
- **Zero-Overhead Utilities**: Debug logging and memory management without release impact
- **Individual Behavior Instances**: Each NPC gets isolated behavior state
- **Mode-Based Configuration**: Automatic setup for common patterns
- **Professional UI Theming**: Consistent appearance without manual styling
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Concurrent access without race conditions
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup and efficient memory usage

### Performance Optimized
- **Scales to 5000+ NPCs**: Linear performance scaling
- **Priority-Based Threading**: Critical tasks processed first
- **Efficient UI Rendering**: Only processes visible components
- **Memory Optimizations**: Smart pointers and efficient containers
